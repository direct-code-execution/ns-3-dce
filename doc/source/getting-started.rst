Quick Start

Introduction
************

The DCE ns-3 module provides facilities to execute within ns-3 existing
implementations of userspace and kernelspace network protocols. 

As of today, the Quagga routing protocol implementation, the CCNx CCN
implementation, and recent versions of the Linux kernel network stack are
known to run within DCE, hence allowing network protocol experimenters and
researchers to use the unmodified implementation of their protocols for
real-world deployments and simulations.

Build DCE
*********

DCE offers two major modes of operation:
 1. The basic mode, where DCE use the |ns3| TCP stacks,
 2. The advanced mode, where DCE uses a Linux network stack instead.

Building DCE basic mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++

First you need to download Bake using Mercurial and set some variables:

.. highlight:: sh
::

  hg clone http://code.nsnam.org/bake bake
  export BAKE_HOME=`pwd`/bake
  export PATH=$PATH:$BAKE_HOME
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$BAKE_HOME

then you must to create a directory for DCE and install it using bake:

.. highlight:: sh
::

   mkdir dce
   cd dce
   bake.py configure -e dce-ns3-|version|
   bake.py download
   bake.py build
 
note that dce-ns3-|version| is the DCE version |version| module. If you would like to use the development version of DCE module, you can specify **dce-ns3-dev** as a module name for bake.

the output should look likes this:

Building DCE advanced mode (with Linux kernel)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you would like to try Linux network stack instead of |ns3| network stack, you can try the advanced mode.
The difference to build the advanced mode is the different module name *dce-linux* instead of *dce-ns3* (basic mode).

.. highlight:: sh
::

   mkdir dce
   cd dce
   bake.py configure -e dce-linux-|version|
   bake.py download
   bake.py build

note that dce-linux-|version| is the DCE version |version| module. If you would like to use the development version of DCE module, you can specify **dce-linux-dev** as a module name for bake.


Building DCE using WAF
++++++++++++++++++++++

While Bake is the best option, another one is the configuration and build using WAF.
WAF is a Python-based framework for configuring, compiling and installing applications.
The configuration scripts are coded in Python files named *wscript*, calling the WAF 
framework, and called by the *waf* executable.
 
In this case you need to install the single packages one by one. You may want to start with *ns-3*:
 
.. highlight:: sh
::
 
   # Download pybindgen (optional)
   bzr clone  https://launchpad.net/pybindgen
   cd pybindgen
   ./waf configure --prefix=$HOME/dce/build
   ./waf
   ./waf install

   # Download ns-3
   hg clone http://code.nsnam.org/ns-3.19
   
   # Configure
   ./waf configure --enable-examples -d optimized --prefix=$HOME/dce/build \
                   --includedir=$HOME/dce/include/ns-3.19 

   # Build and install in the directory specified by
   # --prefix parameter
   ./waf build
   ./waf install
 
 
Then you can download and install *net-next-sim* and DCE (*net-next-sim* includes the linux stack module):
 
.. highlight:: sh
::
 
   # Clone net-next-sim
   git clone https://github.com/thehajime/net-next-sim.git
   cd net-next-sim
   # Select a kernel version
   git checkout sim-ns3-3.10.0-branch
   # Configure and build
   make defconfig OPT=yes ARCH=sim
   make library OPT=yes ARCH=sim
   cd ..
 
   # Download, configure, build and install DCE
   hg clone http://code.nsnam.org/ns-3-dce  -r dce-1.2
   ./waf configure --with-ns3=$HOME/dce/build --enable-opt \
                   --prefix=$HOME/dce/build
   ./waf build
   ./waf install


Examples
********
If you got succeed to build DCE, you can try an example script which is already included in DCE package.
  
Example: Simple UDP socket application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example execute the binaries named udp-client and udp-server under |ns3| using DCE.
These 2 binaries are written using POSIX socket API in order to send and receive UDP packets.

If you would like to see what is going on this script, please refer to the :ref:`user's guide<dce-udp-simple-example>`.


.. highlight:: none
::

  $ cd source/ns-3-dce
  $ ./waf --run dce-udp-simple
  $ ls 
    elf-cache  files-0 exitprocs
  $ ls -lR files-0
    files-0:
    total 4
    drwxr-x--- 3 furbani planete 4096 Sep  2 17:02 var

    files-0/var:

    files-0/var/log/53512:

    -rw------- 1 furbani planete  12 Sep  2 17:02 cmdline
    -rw------- 1 furbani planete 185 Sep  2 17:02 status
    -rw------- 1 furbani planete   0 Sep  2 17:02 stderr
    -rw------- 1 furbani planete  21 Sep  2 17:02 stdout

    files-0/var/log/53513:
    total 12
    -rw------- 1 furbani planete  22 Sep  2 17:02 cmdline
    -rw------- 1 furbani planete 185 Sep  2 17:02 status
    -rw------- 1 furbani planete   0 Sep  2 17:02 stderr
    -rw------- 1 furbani planete  22 Sep  2 17:02 stdout

This simulation produces two directories, the content of elf-cache is not important now for us, but files-0 is.
files-0 contains first node's file system, it also contains the output files of the dce applications launched on this node. In the /var/log directory there are some directories named with the virtual pid of corresponding DCE applications. Under these directories there is always 4 files:

1. cmdline: which contains the command line of the corresponding DCE application, in order to help you to retrieve what is it,
2. stdout: contains the stdout produced by the execution of the corresponding application,
3. stderr: contains the stderr produced by the execution of the corresponding application.
4. status: contains a status of the corresponding process with its start time. This file also contains the end time and exit code if applicable.
              
Before launching a simulation, you may also create files-xx directories and provide files required by the applications to be executed correctly.

Example: iperf
++++++++++++++

This example shows the usage of iperf with DCE. You are able to generate traffic by well-known traffic generator `iperf` in your simulation.
For more detail of the scenario description, please refer to the :ref:`user's guide<dce-iperf-example>`.

Once you successfully installed DCE with bake, you can execute the example using iperf.

.. highlight:: sh
::

  cd source/ns-3-dce
  ./waf --run dce-iperf
  
As we saw in the previous example the experience creates directories containing the outputs of different executables,
take a look at the server (node 1) output:

.. highlight:: none
::

  $ cat files-1/var/log/*/stdout
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Server listening on TCP port 5001
  TCP window size:  124 KByte (default)

  [ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
  [  4]  0.0-11.2 sec  5.75 MBytes  4.30 Mbits/sec

 
the client (node-0) output bellow:

.. highlight:: none

if you have already built the advanced mode, you can use Linux network stack over iperf.

.. highlight:: sh
::

  cd source/ns-3-dce
  ./waf --run "dce-iperf --stack=linux"

the command line option **--stack=linux** makes the simulation use the Linux kernel stack instead of |ns3| network stack.

  [  3]  5.0- 6.0 sec   512 KBytes  4.19 Mbits/sec
  [  3]  6.0- 7.0 sec   640 KBytes  5.24 Mbits/sec
  [  3]  7.0- 8.0 sec   640 KBytes  5.24 Mbits/sec

  [  3]  0.0-10.2 sec  5.88 MBytes  4.84 Mbits/sec

Interestingly, the two results between two network stacks are slightly different, though the difference is out of scope of this document.
