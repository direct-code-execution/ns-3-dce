What is Direct Code Execution (DCE) ?
===

Direct Code Execution (DCE) is a framework for ns-3 that provides facilities to execute, within ns-3, existing implementations of userspace and kernelspace network protocols or applications without source code changes. For example, instead of using ns-3â€™s implementation of a ping-like application, you can use the real ping application. You can also use the Linux networking stack in simulations.

Documentation
===

In case you have a question, you should first refer to the documentation:

* A manual is available at https://ns-3-dce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

And look for answers on the ns3 mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users.

Contribute
===
Development is done on github and bugs should be filed at https://github.com/direct-code-execution/ns-3-dce/issues.

The mailing list used to discuss internals is the same as ns3's: https://groups.google.com/g/ns-developers

License
===
DCE is available under the GPLv2 license. A copy is available in the repository.
